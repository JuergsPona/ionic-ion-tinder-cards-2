Ionic Contrib: Tinder Cards 2
===================

Swipeable card based layout for Ionic and Angular. As seen in apps like [Tinder](http://www.gotinder.com/)
Note: There is also a similar ion library here: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-swipe-cards where you swipe the cards down instead of left or right.

[Demo](http://codepen.io/loringdodge/pen/BNmRrK)

## Install

Coming Soon

## Usage

Include `ionic.tdcards.js`, `collide.js` and `ionic.tdcards.css` after the rest of your Ionic and Angular includes. Add `ionic.contrib.ui.tinderCards` as a module dependency of your app. Then use the following AngularJS directives:

```html

```

To add new cards dynamically, just add them to the cards array:

```javascript

```
